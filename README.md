#UWB IoT Testing Project

#Project purposes
- Testing the new UWB technology of Android devices
- Learn how to use the UWB package
- Check the ability of UWB can discover the surrounding other IoT devices or not

#Getting Started
This project is a starting point for an Android application.

Here are a few resources to get you started if this is your first Android project:

- [Languages: Write your first Kotlin app](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Course: Useful Android samples](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course?hl=en)

#Idea

#Design structure
![MVVM Pattern](https://github.com/jamesli72/UWB-IoT-Testing/assets/141984131/adc4783f-52c2-4d18-9fe9-a1c3e37d4889)
\
This is the common pattern for every Android application, it is good for us to maintain the code in the future.

#Research result
The app is still not able to get the UWB MAC address following the Android developer's instructions, maybe it does not support to discovery of other UWB devices yet in their ecosystem.
The devices used for the research are Samsung Galaxy S21 and DWM1001-Dev Board.
If you have any solutions for the project, I'd appreciate a contribution.
